        <p class="text">
          Sparks foundation STRAY DOGs SHELTER Donation is the name of the project.Dogs are manâ€™s best friend for a reason. Humans and dogs have shared a special bond for centuries. These friendly pups help us reduce anxiety and tension and love us with all they have. While we give sweet and comforting hugs to our pets, there are some poor pups who live on the streets and are often deprived of all the warmth and affection.

          We sometimes feel anxious and sad for these helpless dogs on streets in rough weather conditions and with poor health issues.
